# MachineLearningCourse

This is a repository for a AI / Machine Learning Begginer Series. I'm trying to do a course easy to follow for beginners 
and without prerequisites, it's not necessary know python or Basic Algebra. But is recomendable have some experience programing in any language. 

The course at this moment, is available only in Spanish in this site:

[Classification.Templatev1.ipynb](https://github.com/oopere/MachineLearningCourse)
It's a template to solve Classification problems with a **RandomForestClassifier** estimator fom scikit-learn framework. 
Yo need to change the step 4 to indicate the path of your **.csv** (it can be in a github repository, or anywarte in internet, or just in your HD). the **target**, that is your dependent column, and the **iterations**, more iterations, more chances to improve the model you have.
